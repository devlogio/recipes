    'With a light, crispy exterior and moist interior, Japanese katsu is comfort food at its best.',

    [
      '1/2 cup ketchup',
      '3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce',
      '2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce',
      '1/4 cup all-purpose flour',
      '2 large eggs, lightly beaten',
      '1 1/2 cups panko',
      'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper',
      '2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied and cut into 4 cutlets',
      '1 1/2 cups vegetable or canola oil',
      '2 cups finely sliced cabbage',
      'Cooked white rice, for serving',
      '4 lemon wedges',
    ],
    [
      'For the katsu sauce: Stir together the ketchup, Worcestershire and soy sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.',
      'For the chicken: Set a wire rack in a baking sheet or line a large plate with a paper towel and set aside. Place the flour, eggs and panko into 3 separate large shallow bowls. Stir together 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and then sprinkle the mixture on both sides of the cutlets. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge it in the flour, dip it into the eggs, and then coat it with the panko, gently pressing both sides into the panko to make sure it adheres well. Transfer the cutlet to a plate and repeat with the remaining cutlets.',
      'Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until it reaches about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. (To test for readiness, sprinkle a few pieces of panko into the oil. It should bubble vigorously.)',
      'Working with 2 cutlets at a time to prevent crowding, cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared wire rack or plate, season with salt and let rest for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with the remaining 2 cutlets. (See Cook’s Note.)',
      'Slice each cutlet crosswise into 1/2-inch strips, lay on a bed of sliced cabbage and serve with the katsu sauce, rice and a lemon wedge.',
      'These cutlets are great for freezing for make-ahead meals: Cook the cutlets, but don’t slice them. Let cool completely and then freeze in a plastic bag, placing parchment paper between the pieces to prevent sticking. They will keep for up to 3 months. To reheat, place on a baking sheet in a 350 degree F oven until heated through and crispy, about 15 minutes. Slice before serving.',

      'The yeast: For the pizza dough, combine the yeast and warm water in a bowl of an electric mixed fitted with the paddle attachment. Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes.',
      'The dough: Using a sieve or strainer, sift about half of the flour over the yeast mixture and blend on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the salt, vinegar, honey and remaining flour and mix to blend. With the mixer on medium low, mix the dough 5 to 7 minutes until it becomes a smooth ball in the bowl.',
      'Rest: Lightly oil a bowl with the remaining olive oil and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.',
      'The pizza rounds: Press gently on the dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 pieces, rolling each into a loose ball. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest for an additional 15 minutes.',
      'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.',
      'Flatten each ball, then roll and gently stretch into an 8-inch round. Place each round on a pizza peel or the bottom side of a floured baking sheet.',
      'Prebake: Place the pizza rounds on the center racks of the oven and bake until they become firm and rigid, about 5 minutes.',
      'The tomato sauce: In a medium skillet, warm the olive oil, garlic and tomato paste over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, almost frying the paste. Add 1/2 cup water and let the tomato paste get hot and the garlic soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream, season with salt, stir and shut off the heat.',
      'Get ready: Preheat the grill on high.',
      'The vegetables: In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, red and yellow peppers, onions and red pepper flakes with a generous pinch salt.',
      'Grill: Lightly oil a kitchen towel with canola oil and oil the grill. Arrange the vegetables on the grill and char on all sides until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the grill.',
      'The pizzas: Arrange each prebaked pizza round on the bottom of a baking sheet fitted with parchment paper or on a floured pizza peel. Arrange a quarter of the mozzarella and spoon a quarter of the sauce in a single layer on each of the pizza rounds. Leave a 1-inch edge (the crust) all around without sauce. Top with the vegetables.',
      'Grill: Lightly oil a kitchen towel with canola oil and oil the grill so the pizza won’t stick. Slide the pizzas off the baking sheets right on to a hot (but not the hottest) part of the grill. Close the lid and cook 2 to 3 minutes to allow the dough to finish cooking and the cheese to melt. Move the pizzas gently to a less hot area and cook until browned, an additional 2 to 3 minutes.',
      'Finish: Transfer the pizza rounds to a serving platter. Top with the arugula leaves, lemon zest and Parmesan.',
      'Make your own pizzeria salt: Simply combine 1 tablespoon each of garlic powder, oregano and Parmesan cheese with 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Sprinkle on top of any savory pizza. Tip for topping the pizza: Brushing the dough with olive oil can create a barrier that will help to prevent the topping from making the crust soggy.',

      'In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and cream. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan, reserving 2 tablespoons for garnish.',
      'In a large pot, boil 6 quarts of salted boiling water. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander. Do not rinse with water; you want to retain the pasta\'s natural starches so that the sauce will stick. While the pasta is still hot, return it back to the pot. Add the browned pancetta and mix well. Add the cream mixture and coat the pasta completely. It\'s important to work quickly while the pasta is still warm so that the cream mixture will cook, but not curdle. Add remaining Parmesan and chopped parsley.',

      '2 medium Yukon gold potatoes (about 3/4 pound), cut into 1/2-inch chunks and soaked in cold water until ready to use',
      '3 tablespoons olive oil',
      'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper',
      'Four boneless pork loin chops, 3/4-inch thick, excess fat trimmed',
      '1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, roughly chopped',
      '4 teaspoons drained capers',
      '3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed',
      '3 sprigs of thyme',
      '1 cup halved cherry tomatoes (about 1 pint)',
      '1/2 cup white wine',
      '1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth',
      '1/4 cup packed fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped',
    ],
    [
      'Drain the potatoes. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to become tender and are just beginning to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.',
      'Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper. Move the potatoes to the far edge of the pan, leaving a space to brown the pork chops. Add the pork chops to the pan and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. As the pork chops cook, give the potatoes an occasional stir so they continue to brown evenly. Place the pork chops on top of the potatoes, shingling them to leave as much room in the pan as possible. Reduce the heat to low and add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the bare area of the pan. Add the olives, capers, garlic and thyme and cook, stirring continuously, until fragrant and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.',
      'Increase the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and wine and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the chicken broth. Put the pork chops in the sauce and carefully nestle the potatoes around them. Cook 3 to 5 minutes more until the pork chops register 145 degrees F in the center on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the pork chops from the sauce and transfer to shallow bowls or a serving platter. Taste the sauce and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. If most of the liquid in the pan evaporates while you are cooking the pork, stir in tablespoons of water at a time to get it back to a saucy consistency. If the sauce is a little thin and weak, after you take the chops out, turn the heat up and cook 1 to 2 minutes more to thicken and concentrate the flavors. Stir the parsley into the sauce, remove the thyme sprigs, spoon the sauce over the chops and serve.',
